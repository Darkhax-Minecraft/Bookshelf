# Bookshelf [![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/228525.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/bookshelf) [![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/228525.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/bookshelf)

Bookshelf provides code, frameworks, and utilities that other mods can use. Many mods make use of Bookshelf and it's
shared code to power their own mods.

## Why use a library mod?

Library mods like Bookshelf allow many seemingly unrelated mods to share parts of the same reusable code base. This
reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The shared code is also tested in a
wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and a lower performance impact.
